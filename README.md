# Project Description
A program I made that allows me to search through my work notes. While I was a hardware engineer at Videon, I was learning a lot of new terms and electrical engineering concepts. There were so many notes, that I decided to write a program, that read in my notes, and the allowed me to search through them. This project was written in C++.
